# Basic-Calculator!

This is a  **Basic Calculator** thats will perform rudimentary maths operations between two digits in python. <br/>This project is to demonstrate my flexibility with the basics of python which include variables, functions and conditionals. <br/>To simplify the code I opted to use the **match-case** statement instead of the conventional **If, elif and else** conditional block. <br/>  
Feel free to play with it and hit me back. 
I will be modifying this as I continue to progress in my learning. 
Cheers evryone
